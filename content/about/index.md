I make software, games, and sometimes even software games! I have worked at massive government agencies, tiny startups, and everywhere in between. Tools, systems, and production are my areas of focus, though I appreciate variety. 

I am passionate about using the power of computers to make fun, immersive, and thoughtful experiences. I have worked on several game projects, from small class projects like [*Willowâ€™s Quest*](https://jackburkhardt.com/projects/willowsquest/) and [*Roadkill*](https://jackburkhardt.com/projects/roadkill/) to full fledged games such as [*Intervallic*](https://jackburkhardt.com/projects/intervallic/) and [*Perils & Pitfalls*](https://jackburkhardt.com/projects/perils-and-pitfalls/). I also worked on the virtual reality art installation [*VastWaste*](https://jackburkhardt.com/projects/vastwaste/), which has recently been featured at international exhibitions including SIGGRAPH2022 and ISEA2022.

Offline, I'm mostly reading, cooking, or spending quality time with friends.

You can reach me at ([hello **at** jackburkhardt **dot** com](mailto:hello@jackburkhardt.com)). I have a boundless appetite for knowledge and would love to talk.
