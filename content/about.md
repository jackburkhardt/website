Hello! I am a fourth-year computer science student at Northwestern. Over the last few years I've been able to develop tremendously as a programmer and leader through my work at NASA, Overture Games, and Northwestern. I'm on the hunt for a full-time job starting Summer '24 that will let me use my skills to build meaningful projects as I continue to learn and grow.

I am passionate about using the power of computers to make fun, immersive, and thoughtful experiences. I have worked on several game projects, from small class projects like [*Willowâ€™s Quest*](https://jackburkhardt.com/projects/willowsquest/) and [*Roadkill*](https://jackburkhardt.com/projects/roadkill/) to full fledged games such as [*Intervallic*](https://jackburkhardt.com/projects/intervallic/) and [*KeyWave*](https://jackburkhardt.com/projects/keywave/). I also worked on the virtual reality art installation [*VastWaste*](https://jackburkhardt.com/projects/vastwaste/), which has recently been featured at international exhibitions including SIGGRAPH2022 and ISEA2022.

At Northwestern I am a producer for the [Dillo Day](https://dilloday.com) music festival and am an undergrad teaching assistant for various computer science courses. When not working on tech, I enjoy finding new video games, exploring forest preserves, cooking, and playing with my dog Sam.

You can reach me at ([hello **at** jackburkhardt **dot** com](mailto:hello@jackburkhardt.com)). I have a boundless appetite for knowledge and would love to talk.
