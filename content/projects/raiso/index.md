Below is a list of presentations and discussions I've led for Northwestern's Responsible AI Student Organization [(RAISO)](https://raiso.org/). Unfortunately our Zoom meetings are not recorded, but if I do manage to get a recording I'll link it too.

## May 5, 2021: Flappy Bird: Responsible vs. Addictive Product Design

This presentation was about addictive product design, using Flappy Bird as a launchpad for discussion. We explore different types of addictive software design and questions about government regulation, personal responsibility, and potential solutions.

## May 12, 2021: Facial Recognition Software: To see or not to see? Is there a choice at all?

This presentation discussed how facial recognition software works and the types of situations it's used in. Our discussion delved into potential implications of this technology, such as how accurate it has to be for widespread use and realizing that we are already in a world full of facial recognition.

## May 19, 2021: Judging fish by their ability to climb trees: What exactly is intelligence?

This was a more abstract topic, and as a result I kept the presentation short to maximize our discussion. The presentation part covers different understandings of human and machine intelligence as well as categorizing where AI is at now and what conditions it may need to meet in the future to be truly "intelligent".

## May 26, 2021: Tiktok & China: Is data mining only bad when China does it?

We discussed the processes and uses for data mining, and then focused on some of the more ethical and political implications of the technology. We took a special focus into how Americans are put into a frenzy about China's data mining practices when in reality they are far from the only ones doing those things.

## October 7, 2021: R-E-S-P-E-C-T? Exploring the rules of engagement for sentient machines.

In our first discussion of the 2021-22 school year, we discussed potential social implications of the increasing prevalence of conversational AI and explored potential effects of the emergence a sci-fi esque sentient AI on social structures and interactions.

## November 3, 2021: AI & Personalization: Where is the line between utility and intrusion?

This presentation and discussion focused on personalization algorithms commonly found in social media and web applications. We discussed benefits and drawbacks of these types of algorithms while also attempting to decide what sort of transparency and accountability should be held for tech companies.
