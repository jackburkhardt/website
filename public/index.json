In many of these situations, some people like to be on a phone call with another person. But it\u0026rsquo;s not always possible to get on the line with a real person \u0026ndash; sometimes it takes a while to pick up, and if it\u0026rsquo;s late at night they could even be sleeping. With the recent proliferation of conversational AI chatbots and lifelike text-to-speech systems, we have everything we need to have an on-demand caller to give you an easy out in any situation.\nAngelShot is named after the code word that bar patrons can use to discretely communicate a need for help if they feel unsafe.\nWhy is being on a call more safe? # It implies that someone knows your location and where you are going It gives you an excuse to leave a situation to handle something (like an emergency) You don\u0026rsquo;t have to engage with other people It alerts others to your presence How does it work? # Visit the website and select (or write!) your situation, who you want to \u0026ldquo;talk\u0026rdquo; to, and the tone of their voice (masculine/feminine). Then start talking like you\u0026rsquo;re on the phone! The chatbot is conditioned to keep the conversation going, so you just need to focus on responding to it.\nThe frontend is built with React, TypeScript and Vite. This is my first React webapp, and my team helped a lot with getting me to understand how the project should be structured.\nThe site will stream your voice data to AWS Transcribe, which gives us back a real-time transcription of your speech. The transcription then is sent to an OpenAI chat model which is initially prompted with the context of your situation. The model\u0026rsquo;s output is sent through an OpenAI text-to-speech (TTS) system to play through your phone as if someone is responding.\nYou can view the project code on GitHub. We have successfully deployed the website, however it has been taken down due to the cost of AWS and OpenAI API access.\nChallenges we faced # One of the biggest issues we faced was trying to figure out when the user was done talking as opposed to just pausing. Once the user goes silent, we track the amount of \u0026ldquo;silent time\u0026rdquo; since their last word. But if our waiting time is too long, then we are making the entire system slower to respond. But if it waits for too little time then it could think the user is done talking when they really just paused for a moment. Due to a time shortage, we ended up settling on a silent duration that works \u0026ldquo;good enough\u0026rdquo; based on our own testing. This does mean that users should generally talk with as minimal pauses as possible to avoid confusing the system.\nThe other major hurdle was figuring out how to reduce response times wherever possible. It\u0026rsquo;s pretty unnatural to say something and have the other person wait 10 seconds to respond each time. Each process in our system (the transcriber, chatbot, and text-to-speech) required the previous process to finish first. In other words, we can\u0026rsquo;t have a chatbot respond to only part of a sentence. The solution here was to stream as much data directly to and from the client as possible. So as you speak, that audio is being sent over to amazon and the transcription returned. Then the text-to-speech system is sending its audio back to the client so that it can be played immediately. We\u0026rsquo;ve gotten it down to a few seconds on average from the end of the user\u0026rsquo;s speech to the start of the system response.\n","date":"8 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/angelshot/","section":"Projects","summary":"Making sketchy situations \u0026amp; quick escapes more safe with realistic AI phone calls.

It aims to make instrument practice for students by fun through audio-responsive gameplay, feedback about how you\u0026rsquo;re playing, and encouraging constant practice. The game supports audio input through MIDI and microphone, and will work with many instruments and vocals. Players must play the correct notes to advance through levels and can play certain intervals to activate special abilities or mechanics.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve gotten to build a lot of really cool tech for this game. I\u0026rsquo;ve created a level editor that allows users to provide their own music and design levels around their skills. On the systems side I made many internal tools and did a lot of work with platform integration and player metrics collection. But my work can also be seen on more user-facing features including gameplay and audio/pitch detection. Outside of just technology, I\u0026rsquo;ve learned a lot about how the startup fundraising process works and how to work through difficult times as a team.\nOverture is still a quite small team so I often get to wear a lot of hats. Depending on the day I might act as a writer, producer, business analyst, technical designer, QA tester, or many other critical roles in game and software development. It\u0026rsquo;s been a really awesome way to explore all of the different sides of the industry and has helped me become a more well-rounded developer.\nOnce we got funding from the Techstars accelerator and released Intervallic, I realized that we needed to really get our act together to work with external stakeholders. My last few months with the studio have been focused on smoothing development operations, heavy documentation, and addressing post-release user feedback.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s some early concept art: Lessons # I left Overture in the fall of 2023 due to disagreements about company direction.

Kevin did a ton of work on the combat system and UI, Beck did a lot of art and sound design, and I did most of the writing and gameplay programming.\nThe game follows Willow, an anthropomorphic cat, who has lost their gelatin friend in the forest behind their house. They must venture into the forest to save their friend from the clutches of a Bear, along the way encountering various forest creatures. The gameplay is most akin to an RPG with turn-based combat and somewhat nonlinear questing. The biggest addition to combat we made was a mood system which affects damage output and critical hit chance, inspired by Omori. Other direct inspirations for this game included older Pokemon games, Undertale, and Earthbound.\nReflections # I honestly wish we went with a different type of game. While we all loved RPGs like the inspirations mentioned above, there simply was not enough time in the class to make a game with such complex systems. The result is a game that tries to do some substantial things but ends up falling short due to limits on time and resources. There just isn\u0026rsquo;t enough of some core RPG aspects present here, such as engaging combat, interesting writing and characters, player agency, and progression. Instead it may have been better for us to choose a style of game that would be easy to make but have it be very polished.

I worked under Prof. Ozge Samanci, an artist and instructor at Northwestern University. I did a lot of programming and implementation, including building the projection system, creating visual effects, and other miscellaneous features. This was my first Unity Engine project ever! Once the piece was public I traveled to exhibitions such as ISEA2022 to set up the installation, speak with visitors, and hold talks about VastWaste.\nPremise # Humans once perceived oceans as boundless, and thus impossible to pollute \u0026ndash; until we created the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. The same pattern is now repeating in outer space. VastWaste is a data-driven, projection art installation that illuminates the parallels and interplay between marine pollution and space debris. It can also be experienced in Virtual Reality.\nThe principal difference between these pieces is that Mind the Debris uses a HTC Vive with attached EEG sensors. The sensor data gets sent over to Unity and impacts parts of the installation, including music and collisions. The VastWaste version uses other sources of data to handle debris timing and frequency, such as ocean currents and Twitter data.\nDetails, pictures, and more information about this piece can be found on Ozge Samanci\u0026rsquo;s website (hyperlinked above).\nDevelopment # While VastWaste is primarily intended for VR, we wanted onlookers to be able to share the immersive experience as well. I designed a system that allows the installation to be projected in various orientations onto walls or screens. It uses several virtual cameras, wall-mounted projectors, and a bit of manual tuning to project a stunning space or ocean view on up to 6 surfaces.\nThe supported layouts for the projection system are highly adjustable, which is important as the wall/screen layouts can differ greatly between venues. Some example layouts we\u0026rsquo;ve used this for include \u0026ldquo;room-scale\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;side-by-side\u0026rdquo;, pictured below:\nDespite my inexperience with Unity at this point, I did identify some operational inefficiencies in the development process and worked with the rest of the team to find a solution. We switched from zipping and sending the project files to using Git for version control, and I wrote documentation for the venue tech crew so that they are able to set up in our absence.\nI also did some visual refinement, including color and lighting adjustments, smoothing out scene transitions, and more to make sure it was in tip-top shape for review.\nExhibitions # VastWaste has been featured at several international media arts festivals, including but not limited to:\n06/13/2022 | 27th International Symposium of Electronic Art, Barcelona, ES 08/11/2022 | SIGGRAPH Art Gallery, Vancouver, Canada, BC 10/17/2022 | 20th Piksel Festival for Electronic Art, Bergen, NO 07/05/2023 | FILE Festival 2023, São Paulo, BR 09/19/2023 | NOVA @ Museum of Tomorrow, Rio de Janeiro, BR\nPress coverage \u0026amp; publications # 06/14/2022 | Terrassa Digital 06/25/2022 | Association for Computing Machinery 07/01/2023 | DiVA \u0026ldquo;Digital, Interactive and Visual Arts\u0026rdquo; Vol. 54\n","date":"21 August 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/vastwaste/","section":"Projects","summary":"A VR based art installation showcasing the detrimental effects of space and marine debris.

While this port is about 80% done, it is not yet suitable for production use. As always, you can view more info and submit issues on GitHub.\nWedBars is a version of the the hugely popular Minecraft minigame mode BedWars, which itself is a derivative of other games such as EggWars and CakeWars. This plugin was conceived by myself and Dilan partially as a \u0026ldquo;what-if\u0026rdquo; joke and partially as a Java project for me but quickly turned into a full-fledged server plugin that has become a nearly identical recreation of the Hypixel server\u0026rsquo;s BedWars. It contains features such as an arena setup wizard, robust configuration options, and a MYSQL-enabled player stats system.\nBackground on Bedwars # BedWars is one of if not the most popular Minecraft minigames to ever exist, and is the largest gamemode on Hypixel which is the biggest Minecraft server network ever, averaging roughly 150,000-175,000 concurrent players at the time of this writing. While not invented by Hypixel, all forms of this gamemode (including ours) follow roughly the same overall game structure. Players are placed in teams, usually Solos, Duos, 3s, or 4s, and when the game starts they spawn on a small island which which contains some shop NPCs and a resource generator. The island generators, along with higher tiers of generators in other areas of th map, spawn ingots and gems for players to spend at their NPC shops and purchase tools, blocks, team upgrades, and powerups. Every team has a bed they must defend; if the bed is broken, they become \u0026ldquo;final kills\u0026rdquo; and will not respawn once killed. Players must destroy the beds of other teams and wipe their players while defending their own bed. The game ends when one team is left standing.\nWhy make another one? # I mentioned before that many forms of this gamemode exist, and while that is true, they are almost all created by large server networks with teams of paid developers and all of the code is kept secret. While I was trying to look for a Spigot plugin to run my own BedWars server with, I realized that a lot of the ones that were made by the community lacked features, polish, or updates. So Dilan and I\u0026rsquo;s goal soon turned from just making another version of BedWars for private servers into making a fully-features and polished plugin that could eventually be released to the Minecraft server modding community. In addition to just being able to run our own games, ourselves or other users of this plugin could code in their own powerups or other twists on the gamemode to further improve it.\nThinking beyond 1.8 # Most Bedwars players and servers still operate on Minecraft version 1.8 from 2013 due to the different PvP mechanics. I view the PvP community\u0026rsquo;s reluctance to move past 1.8 as quite a shame since there are so many fresh and innovative possibilities created by the new PvP system and new game features. So in addition to working on a version of this project for 1.8, I\u0026rsquo;ve been porting Wedbars to use the 1.13+ Spigot API (for support of Minecraft versions 1.13-1.17). This port is now almost complete, and once the fundamentals are working I can then turn towards implementing new features made possible by newer versions of the game. New 1.13+ features could include anything from new powerups and blocks to smaller changes like properly colored beds for each team.\nDownloads \u0026amp; Source # You can find the source code on GitHub and download nightly builds from my Jenkins build server.\n","date":"18 April 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/wedbars/","section":"Projects","summary":"A version of the Hypixel server\u0026rsquo;s popular Bedwars gamemode, recreated from scratch.","title":"WedBars","type":"projects"},{"content":" Introduction # I designed, developed, and hosted several iterations of a Minecraft server for the Northwestern community, open to all students of all skill levels. This server was created shortly after our class received admission to Northwestern, which happened to coincide with the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and early quarantine orders. It gave members of our class the opportunity to meet and engage with one another despite only being able to communicate virtually. Since then, this server has had 3 major iterations (plus a brief Pixelmon spinoff), with a forth on the way as of November 2021. Each iteration has coincided with a summer or winter break, and starting with the 2nd and 3rd map incoming members of the class of 2025 also joined us.\nWhile I don\u0026rsquo;t have accurate metrics across server iterations, over 250 players from the Northwestern community have been added to the server\u0026rsquo;s whitelist, with tens of players consistently online during school breaks. As life returns to being in person once more, player activity has dwindled as people are more occupied with activities in the real world. But especially throughout the pandemic, this server provided a fun place for Northwestern community members to meet and hang out with one another, and has led to the creation of several friendships lasting to this day. It\u0026rsquo;s also been a way for me to test out certain Minecraft server development and design methodologies without having to compete to build an organic playerbase. I\u0026rsquo;ve been developing Minecraft servers for nearly a decade at this point, but it is sometimes difficult to test new ideas when you\u0026rsquo;re also trying to manage the business aspects and retain a player count to test with.\nCheck out a student\u0026rsquo;s YouTube video documenting a server event! Key Design Principles # Here are some key pillars of my design of these servers and how I went about implementing them:\nAccessibility for new or inexperienced players # A driving goal of my design was for this server to accommodate players of any skill level, whether they\u0026rsquo;ve never played before or have been playing for a decade. I explain more about how this works below, but some key focuses were on providing resources for help and allowing extra or more advanced content to be optional for inexperienced players.\nUpon logging in, players would receive a book with information about the server itself, its rules, and any custom content. We also had written documentation for some common server commands that players would frequently find themselves using. For the first two maps, we also chose to implement cross-compatibility between Java and Bedrock editions of the game, so that console or mobile users could also join in. This feature was later removed in map 3 due to moderation difficulties and missing Minecraft features that hurt the Bedrock player experience.\nFocus on community building # My biggest concern was that players would just log in and run off to their own section of the map, never interacting with anyone else until they got bored enough to stop playing. There were a few ways I went about mitigating this, including implementing a world border to contain players to a common space, disabling spawn region protection to encourage community projects, and running various whole-server events to bring players together. Some of these events included a holiday-themed visit to the \u0026ldquo;North pole\u0026rdquo; (named after a player, North), a gladiator fighting tournament, and collective tackling of difficult dungeons that were added in map 3.\nThese seemed to work well, and very soon after the start of each map players would form villages together and would frequently ask others to play with them. Some of these groups even got so tight that they became friends once they ended up on campus, and have remained strong friendships throughout college.\nImpactful and attractive gameplay changes # Another way to entice players and keep them engaged with the server was done though the addition of content not present in the base (\u0026ldquo;vanilla\u0026rdquo;) game or in a singleplayer world. These included expansive cave generation with new formations and biomes, new world biomes with varying flora and structures, and additions to game lore such as abandoned villages or dungeons ruled by monsters. The dungeons became especially important when they premiered in map 3, as they were full of loop but extremely difficult for players to defeat on their own. Players often banded together to tackle these, and would leverage tools like the web map to try and find as many of them as possible. There was also an MMO-style skills system that players could level up to unlock special abilities and attributes.\nDespite all of these things, this server was actually very close to vanilla Minecraft. While some of these features were new or enhancements to existing Minecraft features, none of them were so over-the-top as to detract from the original game\u0026rsquo;s experience. This was an intentional choice of mine as I wanted players to be able to engage as much or as little with the custom content as they felt like.\nHigh performance servers # My goal was to have as little bloat as possible that would affect this server\u0026rsquo;s performance, since its baseline demands were so high \u0026ndash; tens of players all over the map exploring and doing stuff at once plus activity loggers for our web map and moderation tools requires a lot of computing power. My solution on the software side was to keep the number of server plugins down and use server software such as Paper to help meet our needs. I programmed in any extra features that were essential to the server but did not require an entire plugin. On the hardware side, this server ran on a recently purchased Dell R430 machine with faster CPU, SSD, and RAM speeds to keep up with the processing demands.\nWorld downloads # You can find world downloads here.\nIf the server is still up, you can view a web map of the current server here: https://map.numc.me\nPictures # The featured image was taken by Collin Porter\n","date":"24 March 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/minecraft-server/","section":"Projects","summary":"A multi-year Minecraft survival server tailored for the Northwestern community.","title":"Northwestern Minecraft Server","type":"projects"},{"content":"","date":"24 March 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/server/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Server","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"12 September 2020","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/bis-mapper/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Bis Mapper","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"12 September 2020","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/fallout/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Fallout","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"12 September 2020","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/fallout-2/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Fallout 2","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"12 September 2020","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/modding/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Modding","type":"tags"},{"content":"Abbey is a partially complete mod for Fallout 2 (1998) that I made right before the start of my freshman year of college. The map itself is complete and likely playable, but it\u0026rsquo;s missing NPCs, quests, and associated scripting and dialogue. Much of the story, quests, and characters exist and are in notebooks of mine, but the main reason it never got finished is that I just ran out of time when school started. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if I will finish the mod but I may try to if I can get around to it.\nBackground # I was looking for a game modding project I could do in the weeks leading up to the start of classes, and being a Fallout fan with plenty of ideas for the series I naturally started eyeing some of the games. I\u0026rsquo;d recently been watching hours on top of hours of playthroughs of Fallout 1 and 2, and figured that they would be easy games to mod relative to their younger 3D siblings (this turned out to be both true and very false). I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure if I wanted to make something fully from scratch, so I browsed around on the Fallout wiki for things I could mod when eventually I stumbled upon Abbey. I felt like this would be a really good place to mod in, as it has some basic lore already made but still has a ton of room for expansion. It also is technically cut content, so there are some remaining references in the base game that will make it easy to link the mod with the game later. It also has defined media as an inspiration, most notably the 1959 book A Canticle for Leibowitz.\nChallenges \u0026amp; Modding tools # Modding Fallout 2, when you break it down, is actually super simple. The main problems are that it\u0026rsquo;s an old game and that the modding community around it is relatively small. As such, most of the tools I used are very old and there is little to no documentation. Almost all existing info and resources are concentrated on the No Mutants Allowed forum and in posts that are sometimes older than me. This posed two problems, a tech problem and a resources problem.\nTech problems # There are several community made tools that I used to make this mod possible, but there are likely more I don\u0026rsquo;t remember. The biggest ones are BIS Mapper (the mapping tool) Fallout Dialogue Converter (a dialogue tree creation tool), and sfall (a scripting tool). There\u0026rsquo;s also several smaller pieces of software I used, such as high resolution patchers to allow the mapper to run at resolutions above 480p, and a .dat file explorer to unpack assets and libraries from the base game. Most of these will not run properly without a compatibility layer, as almost none will run natively on Windows 10. I found that Windows XP/Windows 95 mode seemed to work best for most of these.\nAs you may be able to guess, these tools were janky and finicky at best and straight up didn\u0026rsquo;t work at worst. The mapper itself was a landmine to use; if you didn\u0026rsquo;t open it properly or if you pressed the wrong button, the program would crash or stop working. There\u0026rsquo;s also none of the creature comforts of modern engines and modding tools. You have to manually scroll through assets, there\u0026rsquo;s no easy undo or copy features, and many unknown or broken features.\nResource problems # As I\u0026rsquo;ve talked about before, there is very little information that exists about modding early Fallout games. I have so much appreciation for the NMA forum for keeping all of these old posts and harboring a community for Fallout modders and resources. In absence of real documentation, most of my references were to forum posts which themselves lacked a lot of info (some of the entries on a post about BIS Mapper keymaps just said “crashes”). I’ll share some of those resources below:\nThe guide I used to get started Mapper Keys Wiki tutorials Fallout 2 Modding Wiki Another modding tutorial link Additional tools/critter editors As a sort of aside, this was also the first time I\u0026rsquo;ve worked on an isometric game (although it\u0026rsquo;s technically cavalier oblique). It also uses a hexagonal tilesystem which Tim Cain gives good reasons for in the clip I just linked, but it can be sort of hard to wrap your head around while mapping.\nLore \u0026amp; Design # I\u0026rsquo;ve written a lot of lore for this map but since none of it has been implemented yet I\u0026rsquo;ll keep this to a brief overview. The general idea was that the Brotherhood of Steel was eyeing the monastery for its repository of open information, and was intending to slowly take it over through a series of false diplomatic moves and covert operations such as poisonings. Within the monastery there is division on how to handle the situation; some members have a hunch that the Brotherhood are the ones behind it and want the monastery to take action, but current monastery leaders either don\u0026rsquo;t believe that the Brotherhood is behind it or would rather defend the monestary\u0026rsquo;s principles of freedom of information.\nI wanted to capture the classic Fallout system of choice freedom and consequences, so here are a few possible endings to the questline:\nThe player can side with the Brotherhood, essentially helping them seize Abbey by force The player can side with the faction of monks who are concerned about the Brotherhood The player can side with the current monk leadership Wildcard: The player can solve the quest several more ways than is listed possible here, so I can\u0026rsquo;t include them all. Some options are destroying the libraries yourself, killing Brotherhood spies, and playing double-agent, among others. Each of these options has smaller quests, objectives, and plot points associated with them to allow players to learn more about the world and characters within it. Each choice has implications and consequences, both real and moral, which is what makes them so compelling. Most importantly, the consequences would be communicated to the player as they decide (for example, it\u0026rsquo;s hinted that the Brotherhood will be able to take over the monastery if they player goes with the second option, or that the monks intend to use violence against their own if they go with the third). The player would have the ability to handle each of these options in ways they\u0026rsquo;d like, by stealth, speech, violence, etc within the bounds of Fallout\u0026rsquo;s acceptable character ranges.\nThat’s just the main questline, there’s also a few smaller quests to familiarize the player with various characters and lore to better inform their understanding of the choices in the main quest.\nThis map was made off an existing map in the game, the NCR Downtown mainly because starting fully from scratch would take both time and skill I did not have. From there I basically tore the map apart and rebuilt it based on my drawings. Trying to create and import my own sprites would also be a nightmare, so I resorted to just using existing tiles and sprites. I tried to make sure my map followed a semblance of the lore and could also fit the idea of a monastery based on reference images and information. All in all I think it looks alright; I\u0026rsquo;m by no means a level designer and designing multilevel structures in the mapping tool is another level of difficulty.\nReflections # Even though this was not the easiest project ever, I’m still glad I did it and I hope to finish it one day. I think jumping in the deep end by using an old game without much info was a great learning experience and is a good practice in troubleshooting and experimentation. I’m also not a great level designer, so this was fun practice and in all honesty while the tools can be frustrating at times it’s still fun to do (and much easier than making maps in 3D). Fallout is a series I\u0026rsquo;ve loved for a long time and I especially enjoy the writing and design style of many of Interplay\u0026rsquo;s greats, like Tim Cain, Leonard Boyarsky, and Chris Avellone.\nGallery \u0026amp; Downloads # Here’s a gallery of images for the map and a video demo. There’s also downloads of the map available below; I don’t actually know if I included the right things or how to bundle it with the main game. I know there’s a tool to generate an installer but sadly I don’t have time to set that up now.\nDownload Abbey\u0026rsquo;s map files here\n","date":"12 September 2020","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/abbey/","section":"Projects","summary":"A mod that attempts to recreate cut content from Fallout 2.
