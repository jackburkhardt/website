This game was created as the result of a COVID booster induced fever dream about if [*Crossy Road*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossy_Road) was in first person. *ROADKILL!* does vary from *Crossy Road* in that instead of being an endless runner where the player must get as far as possible, the player is confined to a level and must collect all of the rubber ducks within that level. This is probably the simplest yet most "polished" game I have made yet, despite being made in much less time. I attribute this to a simplification of game rules and systems, a set and coherent art style, and a more refined of implementation for UI, audio, etc that I have worked on throughout this course. This game was submitted as a final project for Northwestern's CS 376 course.

While my original plan was just to re-implement *Crossy Road* but in first person, I ended up deciding that I didn't want to create an endless runner game and instead give people more reason to weave through each lane of traffic. The way I did this was by switching to a level-based approach and sprinkling in rubber ducks that the player must collect in order to proceed. These ducks would be all over the roads and would also require the player to reach every single part of the level from easiest to most difficult.
